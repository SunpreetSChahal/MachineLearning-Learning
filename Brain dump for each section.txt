INTRODUCTION

Go over;
- What machine learning is
- What is the difference between different ML models? Supervised vs Unsupervised vs Reinforcement learning models
**THINK OF MORE POINTS**

---------------------------------
GENERAL ML KNOWLEDGE
- Cover different attributes of a model - like a legend essentially;
	- MAPE vs MSE vs SSE vs RSS vs RMSE vs MAE 
	- P-Value
	- **Look at OLS Linear Regression - Cover each model parameter**
	- **Look at any parameters printed when fitting a model and write up what each thing is**
- Different biases;
	- Selection bias
	- Undercoverage bias
	- Survivorship bias

- Tensorflow or Keras
---------------------------------
FOR EACH MODEL

**Include a link for each practice project that uses the model in question

Go over;
- What that model is
- What that model does
- General layout of setting each model up
- If there are special attributes for that model, e.g.;
	- n_estimators() - Random forest models 
---------------------------------
MATHEMATICAL THEORY

**Read Aldo Faisal; Maths behind ML - From Leo** 
Break up sections for each topic	
	- Linear Algebra
	- Calculus 
	- etc...

**ASK SHANGHUA/BRUNO/LEO: **

1) What is the benefit of understanding the mathematical theory behind machine learning, against just knowing the practical knowledge (coding a model)?
