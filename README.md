# ML Development

*This repo will contain my personal development within learning - Machine Learning.*

- This repo will be updated as I develop my knowledge within ML, I will also try to implement ML techniques into previous projects that I've worked on. 
- I am a hands-on learner, hence why I opted to take the apprenticeship route, and this repo will house various notebooks and saved models that I will create along my learning journey.
- All material here will be material that has been self-taught, however I will try to keep everything as accurate and as detailed as possible. 


Personal note(s):
A ML project isn't just ML, analysing the data is important.
- The general process could look like:
  - Understanding the problem 
  - Collection of data
  - Data Exploration
  - Data preparation
  - Choosing an Algorithm
  - Training a Model
  - Testing and Evaluating the Model
  - End-to-end Deployment
  - #### 50% of the process was data analysis, so overlooking what I'm currently learning as a data analyst apprentice mustn't be overlooked. 

Please note; this repo contains a notebook for reference for use in future projects, this isn't a project but a *journal* of ML that I made.
