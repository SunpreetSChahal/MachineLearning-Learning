# ML Development
*Slight reduplication in the repo title, my apologies.*

*This repo will contain my personal development within learning - Machine Learning.*

- This repo will be updated as I develop my knowledge within ML, I will also try to implement ML techniques into previous projects that I've worked on. 
- I am a hands-on learner, hence why I opted to take the apprenticeship route, and this repo will house various notebooks and saved models that I will create along my learning journey.
- All material here will be material that has been self-taught, however I will try to keep everything as accurate and as detailed as possible. 

- Please note; this repo contains a notebook for reference for use in future projects, this isn't a project but a *journal* of ML that I made.
