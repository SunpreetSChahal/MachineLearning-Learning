# ML Development
*My personal development within learning - Machine Learning. 

- This repo will be updated as I develop my knowledge within ML, I will also try to implement ML techniques into previous projects that I've worked on. 

- Please note; this repo contains a notebook for reference for use in future projects, this isn't a project but a *journal* of ML that I made.
