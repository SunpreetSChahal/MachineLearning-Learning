# Machine Learning Development

*This repo will contain my personal development within learning - Machine Learning.*

- This repo will be updated as I develop my competency with different ML techniques.


### General Project Process:
  - 1) Understanding the problem 
  - 2) Collection of data
  - 3) Data Exploration
  - 4) Data preparation
  - 5) Choosing an Algorithm
  - 6) Training a Model
  - 7) Testing and Evaluating the Model
  - 8) End-to-end Deployment

### Personal note(s):

Please note; this repo contains a notebook for reference for use in future projects, this isn't a project but a *journal* of ML that I made.
