# Machine Learning Development

*This repo will contain my personal development within learning - Machine Learning.*

- This repo will be updated as I develop my knowledge within ML, I will also try to implement ML techniques into previous projects that I've worked on. 
- I am a hands-on learner, hence why I opted to take the apprenticeship route, and this repo will house various notebooks and saved models that I will create along my learning journey.
- All material here will be material that has been self-taught, however I will try to keep everything as accurate and as detailed as possible. 


### General Project Process:
  - 1) Understanding the problem 
  - 2) Collection of data
  - 3) Data Exploration
  - 4) Data preparation
  - 5) Choosing an Algorithm
  - 6) Training a Model
  - 7) Testing and Evaluating the Model
  - 8) End-to-end Deployment

### Personal note(s):
A ML project isn't just ML, analysing the data is important.

###  *The recommendation system isn't complete, this is because I want understand the underlying theory first.
*I will return to this project at a later date to finish the system, as for now (04/12/21), I will work on regression projects first - then progress.

Please note; this repo contains a notebook for reference for use in future projects, this isn't a project but a *journal* of ML that I made.
