# Machine Learning Development

*This repo will contain my personal development regarind Machine Learning studies*

In this repo there's a notebook, a word document (and there will be a final pdf of the doc).
  - The notebook contains brief examples of every model learned up until that point
  - The document will contain further detailed notes, with emphasis on *really* understanding ML.

### General Project Process:
  1) Understanding the problem 
  2) Collection of data
  3) Data Exploration
  4) Data preparation
  5) Choosing an Algorithm
  6) Training a Model
  7) Testing and Evaluating the Model
  8) End-to-end Deployment

### Model Selection:

### Personal note(s):

Please note; this repo contains a notebook for reference for use in future projects, this isn't a project but a *journal* of ML that I made.
